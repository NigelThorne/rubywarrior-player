This is my player for the RubyWarrior game..

> gem install rubywarrior
> rubywarrior 

follow the instructions... 

If you want to try my player, then just replace your 'player.rb' with mine. 

I have tried to make it 'backward compatible' 
I.E. If you are playing a level where you can't 'look' (for example) then my player doesn't try to.

If you want to skip to the level I am on.. just dump all my source in your rubywarrior folder.
